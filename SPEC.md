# repco

This documents outlines a specification and architecture for *repco*, a framework for the exchange of community media and metadata.

## Scope

*repco* deals with repositories of Community Media. Community Media is defined as media (audio, video, pictures) that are produced by community-based, mostly non-commercial media creators. This includes Community Radio stations, recordings of events and lectures, Podcasters and other media collections.

At the core of *repco* is a **domain data model** to represent a number of entities that encapsulate the data of community media:
* `ContentItem`
* `ContentGrouping`
* `MediaAsset`
* `Chapter`
* `Transcript/Subtitle` (?)
* `BroadcastEvent`
* `BroadcastService`
* `Actor`
* `Contribution`
* `License`
* `ConceptGrouping`
* `Concept`

*repco* also defines a set of **REST and/or (?) GraphQL APIs** that are implemented by *repco* nodes to provide public access to repositories of Community Media.

*repco* also defines a **Replication API and data model** to efficiently replicate and exchange repositories of Community Media.

*repco* also includes a set of specification to exchange *repco* data over other protocols, such as **ActivityPub** and **Matrix**.

Finally, *repco* includes a reference implementation of a **data store and gateway** that indexes content from a selection of Community Media providers and makes their contents available through the *repco* data models and APIs.

## Keywords


The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in      [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).


## Identifiers

In *repco*, each entity has a primary, canonical identifier. These identifiers are called **uid**s. A uid *MUST* be a string that is a valid URN as defined in [RFC 8141](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141). The URN *MUST NOT* include [r-components](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-2.3.1), [q-components](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-2.3.2) or [f-components](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8141#section-2.3.3).

If an entity has a matching, externally defined and specified URN, this URN MAY be used as the entity's uid.

If an entity does not already have a defined URN, implementations SHOULD assign a URN in the `urn:repco` namespace. The `repco` namespace is defined as followed:

`urn:repco:<DOMAIN_OF_REPO>:<DOMAIN_ID>`

`DOMAIN_OF_REPO` MUST be a valid DNS hostname owned by the publisher of the entity.

`DOMAIN_ID` can be any valid string that uniquely identifies the entity within the scope of `DOMAIN_OF_REPO`.

Examples:

`urn:repco:cba.media:episode:556557`

### Rationale / Alternatives

We need a unique ID for each entity to easily represent relations and replication across the *repco* system. We chose URNs as the basic formats because they provide a nice balance between a human-readable format and compactness.

Discussion of Alternatives:

* URIs and URLs: URLs (or URIs, which include both URLs and URNs) provide mostly the same properties as URNs. They have the disadvantage that, other than URNs, URIs need to be URL-encoded to be part of the [Path part of a URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.3). In contrast, a URN can be part of the Path part without URL encoding. Additionally, all URLs can be adequately represented as URNs.
* UUIDs: UUIDs are fitting for most part of the system. URIs as defined here have the additional property of providing a way to identify matching data sources for this entity. This makes it possible for the *repco* system to resolve unknown entities by their URN through the provided *repco* data sources.


## Domain data model

Definitions of the entity types outlines above

## Container data model

Definitions of headers, IDs and other *meta* information that encapsulates the domain data model.

Each revision of a domain entity links to a `Revision`, identified by a unique byte string (UUID). A `Revision` stores a number of headers (meta data) about the entity instance. The revision fields are independent of the domain data model type of the entity.

The sorted list of revisions of a repository forms the basis for the replication API (defined below).

* Repository
* Canonical ID (URN)
* Alternative IDs (URIs)
* DataSource
* Timestamp
* Previous Revision

Revision may be signed by their authors.
* Signature

TBD: Are entities and revisions stored in a format that uses CIDs (Content IDs)?
