# Repco data model

Repco defines a data model for the exchange of community media. This represenation is developed to suit a number of domains: Podcasts, community radio and television, conference recordings, collections of cultural heritage, arts.
The data model is intended to be generic enough to fit these domains, and also be specific enough to become a shared basis for replication and shared frontends.

### domain model

The ➜ sigil before a field name denotes that this field is a relation (link) to another entity. Not all relations are marked in the doc, see below for relations left out for clarity of the diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
direction LR
class ContentGrouping {
    groupingType[show, season, event]
    title
    subtitle
    summary
    description
    variant [episodic, serial]
    broadcastSchedule [channel, rrule]

    beginningDate
    terminationDate

    ➜teaserImage
    ➜contributors
    ➜concepts
}
ContentGrouping --> ContentItem
ContentGrouping --> ContentGrouping

class ContentItem {
    title
    subtitle
    summary
    fullText
    ➜teaserImage
    ➜groupings
    ➜mediaAssets
    ➜relatedContentItems
    ➜concepts
}

class MediaAsset {
   title
   description
   mediaType[audio,video,image,document]
   duration
   ➜teaserImage
   ➜concepts
   ➜contributors
   ➜transcripts
}

class File {
    contentURL
    mediaType [audiovideo,image,other]
    mimetype
    size
    hash
    audioVideoTracks?
    imageMetadata?
}

class Chapter {
    start
    duration
    title
    type[music,speech]
    meta
    ➜concepts
}
class Transcript {
    text
    language
    engine
}


class BroadcastEvent {
    start
    duration
    ➜channel
}
class BroadcastService {
    name
    organization
    publications[web,fm,..]
}
class Organization {
    name
    title
}


ContentItem --> MediaAsset
BroadcastEvent --> BroadcastService
BroadcastService --> Organization
MediaAsset --> BroadcastEvent
MediaAsset --> File
MediaAsset --> Transcript
MediaAsset --> Chapter

```

actors and contributions:

```mermaid
classDiagram
direction LR

class Actor {
    name
    type[person,group,organization]
    contactInformation
    ➜image
}
class Contribution {
    ➜contributedTo
    role
    ➜actor
}
class License {
    name
}
Contribution --> Actor
ContentItem --> Contribution
MediaAsset --> Contribution
ContentItem --> License
MediaAsset --> License
end


```

Some relations are left out in the diagram to keep things clearer. Relations not in the diagram but part of the datamodel are:

`License` is linked from `MediaAsset`, `ContentItem`, `Show`, `PublicationChannel`

`Image` is linked from `MediaAsset`, `ContentItem`, `Show`, `Chapter`, `Grouping`

`Contribution` is linked from `MediaAsset`, `ContentItem`, `Collection`

### tagging and categorization

For denoting categories, subjects, tags and similar means of categorizing content, we are looking into a simple-yet-powerful nested and namespaced `Concept` model. Most entity types from above will feature a `concepts` field that relates an entity to one or more `Concept`s. Concepts themselves can be related to other concepts, both in a is-same-as relationship and in a hierarchical relationship. Concepts may be namespaced to make importing existing tagging hierarchies from third parties straightforward.

```mermaid
classDiagram
direction LR

class Concept {
    originNamespace
    name
    summary
    description
    type[subject,person,event]
    wikidataID
    ➜hasParentConcept
    ➜isChildOf
    ➜isSameAs
    ➜image
}
Concept  <--> Concept
Concept --> ContentItem
Concept --> MediaAsset
Concept --> Collection
Concept --> Actor

```

### IDs, headers and changes

- all entities have an `id` property. Q: Will this be an internal or external id?
- all entities have an `alternativeIDs` property with a list of alternative IDs
- more metadata for tracking changes in a `header` property?
