# repco data model in prisma

This folder contains a representation of the Repco data model as a [Prisma schema](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema). The schema is located at [prisma/schema.prisma](prisma/schema.prisma).

The Prisma schema file contains a number of generators that we currently use to try things out. Run `yarn prisma generate` to run all of them. Their output is then found in `./generated`.

What you will find after running `prisma generate`:

* `generated/docs`: Autogenerated Prisma client docs (as HTML)
* `generated/erd-diagram.svg`: An Entity-Relationship diagram of the data model
* `generated/dbml`: A DBML representation of the datamodel. Copy-paste this to [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home?utm_source=dbml) for a visualization.
* `generated/graphql`: A GraphQL schema for the datamodel (without an implementaiton)
* `generated/models`: TypeScript classes from [prisma-class-validator-generator](https://github.com/omar-dulaimi/prisma-class-validator-generator/)
